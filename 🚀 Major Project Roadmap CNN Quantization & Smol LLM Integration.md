### 3. **GPU Training & Mixed Precision (FP16)**

- **Goal:** Leverage the RTX 3060 Ti for efficient training using FP16 precision.
- **Steps:**
    - Configure the training loop to use mixed precision with AMP (if applicable).
    - Monitor memory usage and adjust batch sizes as necessary.
- **Emoji Reminder:**
    - ‚ö°Ô∏è _"Faster training with mixed precision boosts your speed while reducing memory overhead!"_

### 4. **Quantization Aware Training (QAT) with PyTorch**

- **Goal:** Convert your model from FP32 to INT8 (or simulate low-precision arithmetic) to optimize inference.
- **Steps:**
    - Fuse appropriate layers (e.g., convolution + batch norm + ReLU).
    - Set up a QAT configuration (using the appropriate backend).
    - Train the model with fake quantization modules inserted.
    - Convert the QAT-trained model to a fully quantized model.

### 5. **Few-Shot & Zero-Shot Learning Experiments**

- **Goal:** Assess model generalization with limited or unseen classes.
- **Steps:**
    - Create subsets of the dataset with limited samples per class (few-shot).
    - Exclude certain classes during training and test on them later (zero-shot).
- **Interactive Note:**
    - Use Obsidian‚Äôs inline tags (e.g., `#fewshot` and `#zeroshot`) to organize experimental notes.

### 6. **Knowledge Distillation: Teacher & Student Models**

- **Goal:** Transfer knowledge from a high-capacity (teacher) model to a lightweight (student) model.
- **Steps:**
    - Train a powerful teacher model (e.g., a larger CNN).
    - Set up a student model (a smaller or quantized version).
    - Define a combined loss (e.g., cross-entropy + KL divergence) for distillation.
    - Train the student using the teacher‚Äôs softened outputs.
- **Emoji & Tip:**
    - üß† _"Let the master teach the apprentice: Distillation can significantly boost performance in smaller models."_

### 7. **Transferring Techniques to Build a Smol LLM**

- **Goal:** Apply the quantization and optimization insights from the CNN experiments to a simple language model.
- **Steps:**
    - Design a lightweight LLM architecture (e.g., using LSTM or a small Transformer).
    - Apply FP16 training or quantization techniques similar to the CNN pipeline.
    - Evaluate the LLM‚Äôs performance on a relevant text classification or language modeling task.
- **Interactive Idea:**
    - Embed interactive graphs comparing model size, inference speed, and accuracy between the CNN and LLM models.

    - Evaluate each model version (baseline, quantized, distilled, and LLM) using standardized metrics.
    - Save and deploy models using TorchScript or ONNX for real-world inference.
    - Document every experiment in detail, including interactive notes and graphs.
